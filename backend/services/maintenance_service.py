"""
Maintenance Service

Provides data retention and cleanup operations for housekeeping tasks:
- Activity log retention (default: 365 days)
- Bill upload record and file cleanup (default: 730 days)

These are designed to be triggered via the internal API (API-key protected)
on a scheduled basis (e.g., nightly or weekly cron).
